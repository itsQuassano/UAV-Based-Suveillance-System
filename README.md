# UAV-Based Surveillance System  

## Overview  
The **UAV-Based Surveillance System** is an advanced solution leveraging autonomous drones, computer vision, and machine learning to enhance surveillance in remote and challenging environments. This system is designed to detect anomalies in real-time, providing reliable and efficient monitoring with minimal human intervention.  

## Features  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: GPS-guided flight paths with real-time adjustments.  
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Uses advanced computer vision and machine learning models for object recognition and behavioral analysis.  
- **Edge Computing**: Efficient processing on onboard systems for low latency.  
- **Adaptable and Scalable**: Modular architecture for easy integration and future improvements.  
- **Robust Communication**: Reliable protocols to handle signal interference and environmental challenges.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
- **Drone Framework**: ROS (Robot Operating System)  
- **Database**: SQLite  
- **Development Tools**: Docker, Git, Visual Studio Code  

## System Architecture  
### High-Level Architecture  
1. **Drone Hardware**: Equipped with cameras, GPS, and onboard computing units.  
2. **Software Modules**: Includes navigation, anomaly detection, and communication systems.  
3. **Control Center**: Centralized monitoring and management of UAVs.  

### Low-Level Architecture
